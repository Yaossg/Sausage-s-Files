# Many In One

Have you ever tried a modpack with hundreds of mods? Maybe not everyone answers "Yes" because those whose computer always performs badly never imagine they can have such a chance.

But now, here's the chance. Take this mod with your modpack and enjoy 1000 + 1 mods inside! Never mind whether it casue lag for all of those mods are actually empty! You can use this to pool your friend on some special days like April 1st, or just simply tell a lie to yourself about computer situation.

Don't worry this mod will occupy the place of others in the mod list. All of 1000 mods from `000_in_one` to `999_in_one `are the children mods of the 1:`many_in_one`. Remember that an index always begins with 0!

People who have better computer may ask will there be a mod jar contains more than 1000 mods? Potentially yes. Thanks to the limit of gradle, I don't think I can reach a goal like 10000 mods or more and I guess 1000 is good enough for most of us. Note all of these mods will be really loaded by Forge. I am not willing to just edit the number of mods on the lower-left corner. That's not so cool.
